Distributed Training
====================

Distributed training is a technique that allows you to train your pipeline on multiple worker/machines.
This is useful when you have a large model or computation graph that doesn't fit on a single GPU/machine, or when you want to train a model faster by using more resources.

TorchOpt offers a simple API to train your model on multiple GPUs/machines based on the PyTorch |Distributed RPC|_.
Here are some key concepts that TorchOpt's distributed mechanism relies on:

- **Remote Procedure Call (RPC)** supports running a function on the specified destination worker with the given arguments and getting the return value back or creating a reference to the return value.

  That is, you can treat the remote worker as a accelerator. You can call a function on a remote worker and get the result back to the local worker.

- **Distributed Autograd** stitches together local autograd engines on all the workers involved in the forward pass, and automatically reach out to them during the backward pass to compute gradients.

  This is much more flexible to fit the meta-learning use case to have a complex task dependency tree.

Why RPC-Based Distributed Training
----------------------------------

Due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python, only one thread can execute Python code at a time.
This means that you can't take advantage of multiple cores on your machine.
Distribute the workload cross multiple processes, or namely workers, that will run in parallel to gain faster execution performance.
Each worker will have its own Python interpreter and memory namespace.

Compare to single-process programming, you need to be aware of the following:

- **Communication**: You need to explicitly send and receive messages between workers.
- **Synchronization**: You need to explicitly synchronize the states between workers.

Message Passing Interface (MPI) and Distributed Data-Parallel Training (DDP)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`MPI <https://www.mpi-forum.org>`_ is a standard for message passing between processes.
It is a popular choice for `Distributed Data-Parallel Training (DDP) <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dist_overview.html>`_.
PyTorch has implemented this with several `backends <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html#backends>`_, including `Gloo <https://github.com/facebookincubator/gloo>`_, `MPI <https://www.mpi-forum.org>`_, and `NCCL <https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl>`_.

However, MPI-based parallelism has some drawbacks:

- **MPI is not user-friendly**.
  MPI-like APIs only provides low-level primitives for sending and receiving messages.
  It requires the users manage the message passing between workers manually.
  The users should be aware of the communication pattern and the synchronization between workers.

- **MPI is not flexible**.
  MPI-like APIs are designed for `Distributed Data-Parallel Training (DDP) <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dist_overview.html>`_, which is a widely adopted `single-program multiple-data (SPMD) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_program,_multiple_data>`_ training paradigm.
  However, for meta-learning tasks, the task dependency tree is complex and dynamic.
  It may not fit into the SPMD paradigm.
  It is hard to implement the distributed Autograd engine on top of MPI.

- **MPI only communicates the value of tensors but not the gradients and graphs**.
  This is a limitation of MPI.
  The users need to handle the gradients manually cross multiple workers.
  For example, receive the gradients from other workers and put them as ``grad_outputs`` to function |torch.autograd.grad|_.

.. |torch.autograd.grad| replace:: ``torch.autograd.grad``
.. _torch.autograd.grad: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.autograd.grad.html

Distributed Autograd with Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To address the needs of meta-learning tasks, which have complex and dynamic nature of the training process.
TorchOpt uses PyTorch |Distributed RPC|_ to implement the distributed training mechanism.
PyTorch implements the RPC communication operations with appropriate ``RpcSendBackward`` and ``RpcRecvBackward`` functions.
The `Distributed Autograd Engine <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/rpc.html#distributed-autograd-framework>`_ automatically calls these functions to send and receive the gradients between workers.

With **RPC** and **Distributed Autograd**, TorchOpt distributes a **differentiable optimization** job across multiple workers and executes the workers in parallel.
It allows the users to build the whole computation graph (both forward an backward) cross multiple workers.
The users can wrap code in the distributed Autograd module and achieve substantial speedup in training time with only a few changes in existing training scripts.

Here is an example of distributed autograd graph using RPC from `Distributed Backward Pass <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/rpc/distributed_autograd.html#distributed-backward-pass>`_ documentation:

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 13, 18, 28, 31

    import torch
    import torch.distributed.autograd as dist_autograd
    import torch.distributed.rpc as rpc

    def my_add(t1, t2):
        return torch.add(t1, t2)

    # On worker 0:

    # Setup the autograd context. Computations that take
    # part in the distributed backward pass must be within
    # the distributed autograd context manager.
    with dist_autograd.context() as context_id:
        t1 = torch.rand((3, 3), requires_grad=True)
        t2 = torch.rand((3, 3), requires_grad=True)

        # Perform some computation remotely.
        t3 = rpc.rpc_sync("worker1", my_add, args=(t1, t2))

        # Perform some computation locally based on remote result.
        t4 = torch.rand((3, 3), requires_grad=True)
        t5 = torch.mul(t3, t4)

        # Compute some loss.
        loss = t5.sum()

        # Run the backward pass.
        dist_autograd.backward(context_id, [loss])

        # Retrieve the gradients from the context.
        dist_autograd.get_gradients(context_id)

TorchOpt's Distributed Training
-------------------------------

TorchOpt's distributed package is built upon the PyTorch |Distributed RPC|_ and |Distributed Autograd Framework|_.

.. |Distributed Autograd Framework| replace:: Distributed Autograd Framework (``torch.distributed.autograd``)
.. _Distributed Autograd Framework: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/rpc.html#distributed-autograd-framework

TorchOpt provides some utility functions to make it easier to use the distributed training mechanism.

Initialization and Synchronization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: ../_autosummary

    torchopt.distributed.auto_init_rpc
    torchopt.distributed.barrier

Users can wrap their program entry function with decorator :func:`torchopt.distributed.auto_init_rpc`:

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 13

    import torchopt.distributed as todist

    def parse_arguments():
        parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
        ...

        return args

    def worker_init_fn():
        # set process title, seeding, etc.
        ...

    @todist.auto_init_rpc(worker_init_fn)
    def main():
        # Your code here
        args = parse_arguments()
        ...

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()

The decorator will initialize the RPC framework and synchronize the workers on startup.

.. note::

    By default, all tensors must move to the CPU before sending them to other workers.
    If you want to send/receive the tensors directly between GPUs from different workers, you need to specify the ``rpc_backend_options`` with ``device_maps``.
    Please refer to the documentation of |torch.distributed.rpc.init_rpc|_ for more details.

.. |torch.distributed.rpc.init_rpc| replace:: ``torch.distributed.rpc.init_rpc``
.. _torch.distributed.rpc.init_rpc: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/rpc.html#torch.distributed.rpc.init_rpc

Then, users can use |torchrun|_ to launch the program:

.. code-block:: bash

    torchrun --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=8 YOUR_TRAINING_SCRIPT.py (--arg1 ... train script args...)

.. |torchrun| replace:: ``torchrun`` (Elastic Launch)
.. _torchrun: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/elastic/run.html

Process group information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: ../_autosummary

    torchopt.distributed.get_world_info
    torchopt.distributed.get_world_rank
    torchopt.distributed.get_rank
    torchopt.distributed.get_world_size
    torchopt.distributed.get_local_rank
    torchopt.distributed.get_local_world_size
    torchopt.distributed.get_worker_id

After initialize the RPC server, users can use the above functions to get the process group information.

For example, use :func:`torchopt.distributed.get_local_rank` to determine which GPU device to use:

.. code-block:: python

    import torch
    import torchopt.distributed as todist

    def worker_init_fn():
        local_rank = todist.get_local_rank()
        torch.cuda.set_device(local_rank)

    @todist.auto_init_rpc(worker_init_fn)
    def main():
        ...

Worker selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: ../_autosummary

    torchopt.distributed.on_rank
    torchopt.distributed.not_on_rank
    torchopt.distributed.rank_zero_only
    torchopt.distributed.rank_non_zero_only

TorchOpt provides some decorators to execute the decorated function on specific workers.

For example, use :func:`torchopt.distributed.rank_zero_only` to execute the function only on the main worker (``worker0``), such as saving checkpoints or logging the results:

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 3, 7, 11

    import torchopt.distributed as todist

    @todist.rank_non_zero_only
    def greet():
        print(f'Greetings from worker(rank={todist.get_rank()})!')

    @todist.rank_zero_only
    def save_checkpoint(model):
        ...

    @todist.rank_zero_only
    def log_results(writer, results):
        ...

    @todist.auto_init_rpc()
    def main():
        greet()

        ...

        for epoch in range(args.epochs):
            ...

            if epoch % args.log_interval == 0:
                log_results(writer, results)

            if epoch % args.save_interval == 0:
                save_checkpoint(model)

Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: ../_autosummary

    torchopt.distributed.remote_async_call
    torchopt.distributed.remote_sync_call

TorchOpt provides two functions to execute the remote procedure call (RPC) on the remote workers.
The asynchronized version :func:`remote_async_call` function returns a |torch.Future|_ object, and the :func:`remote_sync_call` function executes and returns the result directly.

.. |torch.Future| replace:: ``torch.Future``
.. _torch.Future: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/futures.html#torch.futures.Future

Users can distribute their workload (a function) to a specific worker by:

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 12

    import torchopt.distributed as todist

    @todist.auto_init_rpc(worker_init_fn)
    def main():
        ...

        # Execute the function on the remote worker (asynchronously)
        future = todist.remote_async_call(
            func,
            args=(arg1, arg2, ...),
            kwargs={...},
            partitioner=worker_id,
        )

        # Wait for the result
        result = future.wait()

        ...

or

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 12

    import torchopt.distributed as todist

    @todist.auto_init_rpc(worker_init_fn)
    def main():
        ...

        # Execute the function on the remote worker
        result = todist.remote_sync_call(
            func,
            args=(arg1, arg2, ...),
            kwargs={...},
            partitioner=worker_id,
        )

        ...

TorchOpt follows the `MapReduce programming model <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce>`_ to distribute the workload.

The ``partitioner`` argument specifies the worker to execute the function.
The users can optionally specify the ``reducer`` argument to aggregate the results from the workers.
Finally, the caller will get the reference to the result on the local worker.

- ``partitioner``: a function that takes the ``args`` and ``kwargs`` arguments and returns a list of triplets ``(worker_id, worker_args, worker_kwargs)``.

  The ``partitioner`` is responsible for partitioning the workload (inputs) and distributing them to the remote workers.

  If the ``partitioner`` is given by a worker ID (:class:`int` or :class:`str`), the function will be executed on the specified worker.

- ``mapper``: the ``func`` argument to be executed on the remote worker.
- ``reducer`` (optional): aggregation function, takes a list of results from the remote workers and returns the final result.

  If the ``reducer`` is not given, returns the original unaggregated list.

Predefined partitioners and reducers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: ../_autosummary

    torchopt.distributed.dim_partitioner
    torchopt.distributed.batch_partitioner
    torchopt.distributed.mean_reducer
    torchopt.distributed.sum_reducer

We provide some predefined partitioners and reducers.
Users can combine the :func:`torchopt.distributed.batch_partitioner` and :func:`torchopt.distributed.mean_reducer` to achieve the distributed data parallelism (DDP) easily:

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 18, 19

    import torchopt.distributed as todist

    def loss_fn(model, batch):
        ...

    @todist.rank_zero_only
    def train(args):

        for epoch in range(args.epochs):
            ...

            for batch in dataloader:
                # Partition the data on the batch (first) dimension and distribute them to the remote workers
                # Aggregate the results from the remote workers and return the mean loss
                loss = todist.remote_sync_call(
                    loss_fn,
                    args=(model, batch),
                    partitioner=todist.batch_partitioner,
                    reducer=todist.mean_reducer,
                )

                ...

We also provide a :func:`torchopt.distributed.dim_partitioner` to partition the data on the specified dimension.
While implementing the **Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning** (MAML) :cite:`MAML` algorithm, users can use this to parallel the training for the inner loop:

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 29, 30

    import torchopt.distributed as todist

    def inner_loop(model, task_batch, args):
        # task_batch: shape = (B, *)
        inner_model = torchopt.module_clone(model, by='reference', detach_buffers=True)

        # Inner optimization
        for inner_step in range(args.inner_steps):
            inner_loss = inner_loss_fn(inner_model, task_batch)

            # Update the inner model
            ...

        # Compute the outer loss
        outer_loss = inner_loss_fn(inner_model, task_batch)
        return outer_loss

    @todist.rank_zero_only
    def train(args):

        for epoch in range(args.epochs):
            ...

            for batch in dataloader:
                # batch: shape = (T, B, *)
                outer_loss = todist.remote_sync_call(
                    inner_loop,
                    args=(model, batch),
                    partitioner=todist.dim_partitioner(0, exclusive=True, keepdim=False),
                    reducer=todist.mean_reducer,
                )

                ...

The the ``dim_partitioner(0, exclusive=True, keepdim=False)`` will split the batch of size ``(T, B, *)`` into ``T`` batches of size ``(B, *)``.
Each task will be executed on the remote worker independently.
Finally, the results will be aggregated by the :func:`torchopt.distributed.mean_reducer` to compute the mean loss.
Inside the ``inner_loop`` function, users may use another RPC call to further parallelize the inner loop.

Function parallelization wrappers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: ../_autosummary

    torchopt.distributed.parallelize
    torchopt.distributed.parallelize_async
    torchopt.distributed.parallelize_sync

TorchOpt offers wrappers to parallelize the function execution on the remote workers.
It makes the function execution on the remote workers more transparent to the users and makes the code structure more clear.

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 3, 9, 10, 11, 12

    import torchopt.distributed as todist

    @todist.parallelize(partitioner=todist.batch_partitioner, reducer=todist.mean_reducer)
    def distributed_data_parallelism(model, batch, args):
        # Compute local loss of the given batch
        ...
        return loss

    @todist.parallelize(
        partitioner=todist.dim_partitioner(0, exclusive=True, keepdim=False),
        reducer=todist.mean_reducer,
    )
    def inner_loop(model, batch, args):  # distributed MAML inner loop
        # batch: shape = (B, *)
        inner_model = torchopt.module_clone(model, by='reference', detach_buffers=True)

        # Inner optimization
        ...

        # Compute the outer loss
        outer_loss = inner_loss_fn(inner_model, task_batch)
        return outer_loss

    @todist.rank_zero_only
    def train(args):

        for epoch in range(args.epochs):
            ...

            for batch in dataloader:
                # batch: shape = (T, B, *)
                outer_loss = inner_loop(model, batch, args)

                ...

Distributed Autograd
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: ../_autosummary

    torchopt.distributed.autograd.context
    torchopt.distributed.autograd.get_gradients
    torchopt.distributed.autograd.backward
    torchopt.distributed.autograd.grad

In this section, we will introduce the distributed autograd system.
Please refer to `Autograd mechanics <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/autograd.html>`_ and `Distributed Autograd Design <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/rpc/distributed_autograd.html>`_ first before going through this section.

Recap: Autograd mechanics in single-process training
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

For single-process training, the autograd engine will automatically track the operations on forward pass and compute the gradients on backward pass.
For each operation, if the input tensors has ``requires_grad=True`` set, the output tensor will have a ``grad_fn`` attribute to trace the computation graph.
On backward pass, the autograd engine will traverse the computation graph from the output tensors to the input tensors and compute the gradients for each operation.

The |torch.autograd.grad|_ function will compute the gradients of the given ``outputs`` with respect to the given ``inputs``.

.. code-block:: python

    import torch

    model = build_model()
    loss = compute_loss(model, data)

    params = tuple(model.parameters())
    grads = torch.autograd.grad(loss, params)

    print(grads)

In practice, users usually use the PyTorch Autograd Engine with ``loss.backward()`` (or |torch.autograd.backward|_) and optimizers:

.. code-block:: python

    import torch
    import torch.optim as optim

    model = build_model()
    optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=lr)

    loss = compute_loss(model, data)

    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

Compare to |torch.autograd.grad|_, the |torch.autograd.backward|_ function will sum and update the ``.grad`` attribute of the parameters.

.. |torch.autograd.backward| replace:: ``torch.autograd.backward``
.. _torch.autograd.backward: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.autograd.backward.html

RPC-based Distributed Autograd
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

PyTorch RPC framework implements the communication ``send-recv`` operations with appropriate backward functions (``RpcSendBackward`` and ``RpcRecvBackward``).
They can be tracked by the distributed Autograd engine like the single-process program we discussed above.

The only difference between the single-process and distributed training is that users need to explicitly create a **distributed Autograd context** and wrap around the forward and backward passes.

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 4, 9, 12

    import torch
    import torch.distributed.autograd as dist_autograd

    with dist_autograd.context() as context_id:
        # Forward pass
        loss = ...  # e.g. remote calls

        # Backward pass
        dist_autograd.backward(context_id, [loss])

        # Retrieve the gradients from the context.
        grad_dict = dist_autograd.get_gradients(context_id)  # type: Dict[Tensor, Tensor]

.. warning::

    Sending |torch.nn.Parameter|_ over RPC will automatically detach from the Autograd graph.
    This is an intentional behavior of the PyTorch framework, because the parameters are always leaf tensors.
    The leaf tensors will not have ``grad_fn`` attribute and thus cannot be tracked by the Autograd engine.

    To make the graph can be properly tracked, users should convert the parameters to tensors before sending them over RPC.
    For example, explicitly ``clone()`` the parameters to tensors before take them as arguments of the RPC call.

    .. code-block:: python

        import torch
        import torch.distributed.rpc as rpc

        def compute_loss(param):
            return param.mean()

        param = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.randn(2, 2), requires_grad=True)

        # The RPC call will detach the parameter from the Autograd graph on worker1
        loss1 = rpc.rpc_sync('worker1', compute_loss, args=(param,))

        # The RPC call will keep connection to the parameter in the Autograd graph on worker1
        loss2 = rpc.rpc_sync('worker1', compute_loss, args=(param.clone(),))

    Users can use :func:`torchopt.module_clone` function to clone the module and convert the parameters to tensors.
    The tensors will have a ``grad_fn`` attribute ``CloneBackward`` to track the computation graph to the original parameters.

    .. code-block:: python

        import torch
        import torch.nn as nn
        import torchopt

        model = nn.Linear(2, 2)
        tuple(model.parameters())  # -> `nn.Parameter`s

        cloned_model = torchopt.module_clone(model, by='clone')
        tuple(cloned_model.parameters())  # -> `torch.Tensor`s with `CloneBackward` grad_fn

        def compute_loss(model, batch):
            ...
            return loss

        # The RPC call will detach the parameter from the Autograd graph on worker1
        loss1 = rpc.rpc_sync('worker1', compute_loss, args=(model, batch))

        # The RPC call will keep connection to the parameter in the Autograd graph on worker1
        loss2 = rpc.rpc_sync('worker1', compute_loss, args=(cloned_model, batch))

.. |torch.nn.Parameter| replace:: ``torch.nn.Parameter``
.. _torch.nn.Parameter: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.parameter.Parameter.html

TorchOpt wraps the distributed autograd context and provides a more convenient interface to use.

.. warning::

    The distributed Autograd context is not thread-safe.
    Users should not use the same context in multiple threads.

Users can update their single-process training code to distributed training code with minimum changes:

#. Add the distributed Autograd context around the forward and backward passes.
#. Wrap the functions with :func:`torchopt.distributed.parallelize` to enable parallel execution.
#. Convert the parameters to tensors before sending them over RPC.
#. Replace the ``torch.autograd`` to ``torchopt.distributed.autograd``.

Here is a full example of converting the single-process training code to distributed training code:

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 17, 32, 40, 42, 43, 47, 52

    import torch
    import torch.nn as nn
    import torchopt.distributed as todist

    def parse_arguments():
        parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='TorchOpt Distributed Training')
        ...

        args = parser.parse_args()
        return args

    def worker_init_fn():
        # set process title, seeding, etc.
        setproctitle.setproctitle(f'Worker{todist.get_rank()}')
        torch.manual_seed(args.seed + todist.get_rank())

    @todist.parallelize(partitioner=todist.batch_partitioner, reducer=todist.mean_reducer)
    def compute_loss(model, batch):
        device = torch.device(f'cuda:{todist.get_local_rank()}')
        model = model.to(device)
        batch = batch.to(device)

        # Compute local loss of the given batch
        ...
        return loss.cpu()

    def build_model():
        return nn.Sequential(
            ...
        )

    @todist.rank_zero_only
    def train(args):
        model = build_model()
        optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=args.lr)
        train_loader = ...

        for epoch in range(args.epochs):
            for batch in train_loader:
                with todist.autograd.context() as context_id:
                    # Forward pass
                    cloned_model = todist.module_clone(model, by='clone')
                    loss = compute_loss(cloned_model, batch)

                    # Backward pass
                    optimizer.zero_grad()
                    todist.autograd.backward(context_id, loss)

                    # Update parameters
                    optimizer.step()

    @todist.auto_init_rpc(worker_init_fn)
    def main():
        args = parse_arguments()
        train(args)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()

Then, users can use |torchrun|_ to launch the program:

.. code-block:: bash

    torchrun --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=8 YOUR_TRAINING_SCRIPT.py (--arg1 ... train script args...)
